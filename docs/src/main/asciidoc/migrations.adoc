In the following document we will write about necessary migration steps between versions.

=== 1.0.x -> 1.1.x

TODO: https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/issues/350

=== 1.1.x -> 1.2.x

==== Custom `HttpServerStub`

By introducing a method `String registeredMappings()` in the public interface
`HttpServerStub`, if you wrote a custom `HttpServerStub` implementation, you'll
have to implement that method too. It should return a `String` representing
all mappings available in a single `HttpServerStub`. Related to
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-contract/issues/355[issue 355].
